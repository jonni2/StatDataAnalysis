This is a collection of topics discussed during past examinations.

The list is related only to the teaching program of the Laboratory 
(Module 3, G.Sirri). The list is not exhaustive.

During the oral examination, teachers are not be bound to this list, 
and the discussion of connections with theory and complements is
appreciated.

[MODELLING]

 

- Terminology: Ensamble, Experiment, Channel, Observable, 
  Parameters of Interest, Nuisance, Distribution, ... 

 - The Marked Poisson Model, Extended Likelihood, ...

 - Slice Likelihood vs Profile Likelihood

 - the p.d.f. of a generic extended composite model,
  composite means signal + background
 - Nuisance parameters and POI
 

 

[FITTING]

- The list of algorythms implemented in MINUT. What are meant for?

- The difference MINOS vs MIGRAD/HESSE

- The theory behind the error computation by HESSE

- The connection between MINOS and Profile Likelihood Interval

- common fitting problems...  sources of fit instability, how to deal with?

- example of a simple model where fitting problems may be expected.
  how to fix?
- source of fit instability? can you write an example of probability model where we can expect
fit instability?
 

[MVA]  
- Definition of (signal|background) efficiency.
	eps_s = selected_sig/total_sig = 1-beta
	eps_b = selected_bkg/total_bkg = alpha

- Definition of background rejection power. = 1-eps_b = 1-alpha

- Definition of Signal purity = p(s!xâ‚¬W) = eps_s*N_s/(eps_s*N_s + eps_b*N_b)

- The ROC curve. How to build a ROC curve.

- We have to set the best cut on the output of some classificator
  to be applied to the search of signal over a background. 
  We have the ROC curve. Is it sufficient?
	No, I mean, it's not even useful (?)
	What we must do to set the best cut is to study the distrib of the test statistic and
	put the cut also according to the NUMBER of SIG and BKG EVENTS

- which strategy we have to apply to find the best cut 
  for significance discovery?
	Maximize expected significance (see slides SIOLI 16/72)

- ROC curve with disjoint PDFs
	It should be the STEP function (ideal BEST ROC curve in the Universe!!)

- optimal cut for classification
- how can I see overtraining in TMVA
  Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (topic discussed in theory/complements)
  
[SYSTEMATICS]

- The ON/OFF problem. Make an example (i.e. a counting model).

- Profile Likelihood Ratio as test statistics.
  How is distributed the test statistics if H0 is true/false.
  if the model is not correct how is the test 
  statistics distributed. 
- how incorporate systematics in a generic (marked poisson) model.

- signal/control regions, constraint terms, global observables

- nuisance parameters: profile likelihood and parameter marginalization

- Do you know some way to estimate intervals in presence of nuisance parameters?
